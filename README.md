# Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Implementations
Python implementations of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms in Python and Tensorflow with an 
emphasis on readability.

1. Proximal Policy Optimization
2. Advantage Actor Critic

Inspired by the implementations published by [MorvanZhou](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow).
